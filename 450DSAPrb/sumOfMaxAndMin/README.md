# Sum of Maximum and Minimum Elements in an Array

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `ARR` of size `N`. Your task is to find and return the **sum of the maximum and minimum elements** present in the array.

---

## Follow-Up

Can you solve the problem using the **minimum number of comparisons**?

---

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `T`, the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer `N`, the size of the array.
  - The second line contains `N` space-separated integers representing the array `ARR`.

---

## Output Format

- For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the maximum and minimum values in the array.

---

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10  
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵  
- -10⁹ ≤ ARR[i] ≤ 10⁹  
- Time Limit: 1 second
